## For Website Operators

If you have some basic web hosting skills, then you can use Sharedigm to deploy your own platform to manage your own data.

### 1. [Sharedigm](https://github.com/Sharedigm/Sharedigm)

The Sharedigm platform includes a range of apps for most common data sharing applications.  If you are just getting started with Sharedigm or just want to deploy a data sharing platform rather than to build your own custom platform, we recommend that you start with this platform.

### 2. [RocketKitty](https://github.com/Sharedigm/RocketKitties)

If just want to deploy a version of the Sharedigm platform as easily as possible with a minimum of customization or configuration, we also provide a family of pre-configured platforms build on top of the Sharedigm platform but customized for particular tasks.

## For Web Developers
If you are a developer, then you can use the Sharedigm OS to build your own customized cloud sharing platform.

- Build your own platform by customizing the set of installed apps, configuration, branding, and theme to match your own needs.
- If you have coding skills, you can create new apps for the platform to suit your specific needs. 

### 1. [Sharedigm OS](https://github.com/Sharedigm/SharedigmOS)

The Sharedigm OS is the base operating system that the Sharedigm platform is built upon.  The Sharedigm OS is provided with a minimum of apps installed so you can build your own platform by installing additional apps from the Sharedigm App Store or by creating your own apps.

### 2. [Sharedigm App Store](https://github.com/Sharedigm/SharedigmAppStore)

The Sharedigm app store is a repository of apps that can be installed on the Sharedigm OS.  Each app includes an installer and uninstaller to make it easy to install the apps that you want in order to tailor the platform to your specific needs.
